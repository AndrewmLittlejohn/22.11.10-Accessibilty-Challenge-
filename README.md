# 22.11.10-Accessibilty-Challenge-

The Accessibility Challenge is an "on-the'job'ticket" challenge. We have been provided starter code. We are to go in an make adjustments to the underlying code to increase the pages accessibilty, thus increasing the usabilty of the page for all users. 

This is done by adjusting the code to provide more information and insight in the underlying code.  

I used a variety of sources for guidance and information including usability.gov and digital.gov
